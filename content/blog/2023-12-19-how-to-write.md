title: Front matter as markdown header i.e. YAML format part separated with 3 hyphens('---') before and after the header part
---
<!-- title: Front matter in HTML comment -->
## Difference from original *makesite*
- Originally, meta data (aka front matters) are set as comments of HTML.
- In this fork, meta data are written in leading 3-hyphen separated part as YAML format(YAML format is like a simplified JSON format).

## Notice:
- Headings start from H2 aka double crosshatches
 Since H1 is set with `title` in the front matter.
